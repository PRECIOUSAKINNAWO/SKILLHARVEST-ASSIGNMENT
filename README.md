# Inference and Insight
---
according to the data analysed;
- Parts and Service plans sold the highest on Workdays, only Parts was able to sell a little on Public Holiday. The stores selling these products should make an effort to read their customers needs during the holiday periods and work towards pleasing them.
- stores that had average sales per year are more than stores that had low or high sales. this means they are in a bit of stagnancy, while sales are not bad, they can be better.
- the lowest revenues were detected in Kwali, Boki, Isiala Ngwa South and Chibok respectively, there be a need to change the managemnt of those stores and see what can be improved.
- the lowest units sold were also from the stores above. The suggestion above still applies.
